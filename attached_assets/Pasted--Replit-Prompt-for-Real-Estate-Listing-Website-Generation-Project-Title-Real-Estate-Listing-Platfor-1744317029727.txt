 Replit Prompt for Real Estate Listing Website Generation
Project Title: Real Estate Listing Platform (HomeVerse Clone)

🔧 Important Development Instructions:
You are tasked with generating a Real Estate Listing Platform with the following strict requirements:

🔷 1. Tech Stack Instructions:
✅ Use ONLY the MERN Stack:

MongoDB

Express.js

React.js

Node.js

⚠️ This is mandatory as the final project needs to be deployed on Render, which supports only the MERN stack.

🔷 2. Project Folder Structure:
The folder structure must be strictly as follows:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
RealEstate-Platform/
│
├── BACKEND/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── .env         <-- Include environment variables here
│   └── server.js
│
├── FRONTEND/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   └── App.js
│   └── package.json
│
├── ADMIN/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   └── App.js
│   └── package.json
❌ Do not include any folders other than BACKEND, FRONTEND, and ADMIN.

🔷 3. Language & Libraries Instructions:
On FRONTEND and ADMIN, use:

React.js

HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UI (No frameworks like Angular/Vue)

React Router for page navigation

Axios for API communication

On BACKEND, use:

Express.js

MongoDB with Mongoose

Environment variables should be stored in .env

Use CORS and body-parser middleware

🔷 4. Core Features to Implement:
✅ User Roles: Buyers, Sellers, Admins/Agents

✅ Property Listings with Image Uploads

✅ Search & Filter Properties (location, price, type)

✅ Contact Form for Property Inquiries

✅ Responsive UI for all devices

✅ Separate Admin Panel (in ADMIN/) for managing listings and users

🔷 5. Deployment Readiness:
Code must be clean and modular to support deployment on Render.com

Include MongoDB Atlas connection string in .env (example)

All routes should be tested and functional

📦 Final Notes:
Do not use additional folders outside the specified structure.

Keep codebase simple, scalable, and clean.

Make sure the site is fully deployable and includes all core real estate feature
